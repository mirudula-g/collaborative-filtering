This project implements a movie recommender using **collaborative filtering** to suggest personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.

## 📌 Features
- Predicts top 5 movie recommendations for a selected user
- Based on user-item interactions from the MovieLens dataset
- Uses cosine similarity or matrix factorization techniques

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn or PySpark (for large datasets)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualizations)

## 🗃️ Dataset
- [MovieLens 100k Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo or download the files
2. Install required libraries:
